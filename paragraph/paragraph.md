## The kind, humorous and rigorous John Chiasson

On February 26, 2025, the world lost John Nelson Chiasson: a deeply kind and
compassionate soul, a brilliant mind, and a dedicated teacher. He brightened
every life he touched with his endless humor, his vast knowledge, and his
genuine care. John embraced laughter, both giving and receiving, with
unwavering good humor.

A Life Fellow of the IEEE with an impressive h-index of 52, John's
groundbreaking work on electric machines, particularly his influential book,
_Modeling and High-Performance Control of Electric Machines_, has had a lasting
impact on the field. In the recent years, he continued to contribute to
scientific advancements through his research on spiking neural networks as well as
on advancing robotic manipulation with drones. His legacy lives on through his
family, his students/advisees, and his pioneering contributions to science.
