    "text": "Mark W. Spong\n\n\n\n\n\nI met John Chiasson when both of us were still in graduate school. I visited his group in Minnesota that was working under Bruce Lee. John and I were both studying the control of time-delay systems. Later, John came to the Allerton Conference on Communication, Control, and Computing at Illinois around 1983, I think, and we had a good time there. I always enjoyed my interactions with John. I visited him at Purdue several times and stayed at his house. John had a wonderful sense of humor. I remember how the group at Purdue would tease one another mercilessly. I think John led the group in this regard.\nMy wife, Lila, also became good friends with John. One funny anecdote was when we were talking about family traditions at Christmas. Lila grew up in Mexico City and John told us how his family always had Mexican food at Christmas. He asked Lila what her family had for Christmas dinner expecting, I’m sure, that her answer would involve some special Mexican cuisine. “Oh, we have turkey,” was Lila’s answer. We got a good laugh out of that.\nJohn was a brilliant researcher, perhaps under appreciated in his time. His work on the control of motors with Marc Bodson, in particular, was exceptional. John was also a great educator. I always encouraged him to turn his extensive set of lecture notes into textbooks, which he eventually did.\nJohn gave so many of us in the control field pleasure with his humor and companionship. He will be greatly missed.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMark W. Spong"
